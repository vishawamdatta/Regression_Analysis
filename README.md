# Regression_Analysis
Determining the relative importance of feature variables by varying lambda values in ridge and lasso regression.

Used the ridge and lasso regression models and plotted a graph
between different values of regularization coefficient (lambda)
and the coefficients of the feature variables.On increasing lambda 
the features whose coefficients decrease at a rapid rate are found 
to be less important and may cause overfitting because these may adjust 
to the errors between the actual and the predicted values instead of predicting 
the required values.
